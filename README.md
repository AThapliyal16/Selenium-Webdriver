# Selenium-Webdriver

Selenium Webdriver- Whenever any application is developed ,then we need to do test them as well, and that testing can be done manually or using automation tool.
so here we used Selenium tool which is most popular tool for automation.

1. It is an open source browser autimation library
2. Supports cross browser web testing
3. Supports several programming languages like javascript,java,python etc.
We are using javascript because since everyone has hands on it and it is one the most popular language that is used for writting automation scripts.

Below is the code Explanation:-
# const {Builder, By, Key, until, Select} = require('selenium-webdriver');
# const rp = require('request-promise');

This imports the necessary libraries. selenium-webdriver is used to automate browser interactions, and request-promise is used to make HTTP requests (for sending OTP or Slack notifications).
